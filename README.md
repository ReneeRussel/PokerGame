# Privacy Poker Game

A revolutionary blockchain-based poker game leveraging **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** and **Meta Transactions** to deliver unprecedented privacy and user experience in decentralized gaming.

## üîê Core Concept

**FHE Contract Privacy Poker Game** - A confidential card game where all player data remains encrypted throughout the entire game lifecycle. Using advanced cryptographic techniques, players can participate in poker games without revealing their cards, bets, or strategies to other participants or even the blockchain itself.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üÉè **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**
- **Private Card Dealing**: All cards are encrypted and remain hidden until reveal
- **Confidential Betting**: Bet amounts are encrypted, preventing information leakage
- **Hidden Player Actions**: Call, raise, and fold decisions are processed in encrypted form
- **Secure Hand Comparison**: Hand strength evaluation without exposing actual cards

### üöÄ **Meta Transactions**
- **Gasless Gaming**: Players can participate without paying gas fees
- **EIP-712 Signatures**: Secure transaction signing using typed data standards
- **Relayer Network**: Automated transaction submission through trusted relayers
- **Seamless UX**: Blockchain interaction feels like traditional web applications

### üéÆ **Game Varieties**
- **Texas Hold'em**: Classic poker with encrypted community cards
- **Five Card Draw**: Traditional draw poker with full privacy
- **Omaha**: Advanced variant with multiple hole cards
- **Seven Card Stud**: Skill-based game with progressive reveals
